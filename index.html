                <h3>OUR FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT TRACK - START APRIL 6</h3>
                <p>
                        If you like creating things, <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/what-is-a-FD.html" target="_blank"> front-end development is for you. </a> Itâ€™s easy to learn. Sureâ€”youâ€™ll have to put in the hours, but itâ€™s one of those skills that will give you <em> immediate gratification: </em> you see what you build.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Itâ€™s also <em> high in demand, low in supply.</em> This means: a good salary, easy to land a job, and a quick road to a permanent position (if thatâ€™s what you desire). Frontend development is also highly flexible, which means you can arrange your work around the things that are important to you.
